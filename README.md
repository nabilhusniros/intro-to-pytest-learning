# Portfolio: PyTest Learning

This repository showcases my skills in testing with PyTest through a collection of examples and exercises. It covers the basics, including writing tests, test collection, and running tests.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python
- PyTest (install with `pip install pytest`)

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/nabilhusniros/intro-to-pytest-learning.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd intro-to-pytest-learning`

**Running Tests:**

Each example has a `test_.py` file with tests. To run tests for an example:

1. Navigate to the example directory (e.g., `cd test`).
2. Run: `python - m -pytest`


**Example Structure:**

The `test` directory contains folders for each example, named like `test_accum.py`, `test_math.py`, etc.


**Additional Notes:**

- You can use `pytest -v` for more verbose output.
